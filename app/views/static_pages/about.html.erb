			<h2 class="header">The Business</h2>		
			<p class="biography">George's Seafood is located in Norfolk, VA; a large military community and the largest naval base in the world. Yet, for George Georgiades, Norfolk was all about the fish. Born and raised here, he took a hobby of sport fishing and turned it into a commercial fishing operation. Norfolk borders the lower Chesapeake Bay and the Atlantic Ocean which provides access to a variety of migrating fish coming and going, domestic USA wild caught fish- George's specialty. Cape Henry and Cape Charles are close by as well, located by the 17 mile Chesapeake Bay Bridge Tunnel, a natural fish haven. </p>

			<h2 class="header">History</h2>
			
			<p class="biography">George started this business 43 years ago; just two years out of high school. During those two years he worked on both commercial and sport fishing boats. George's affiliation with the local commercial and sport fisherman helped build this business. Also, having a father that was a Greek immigrant and local resturant purveyor attributed to his success. But more then anything, was sacrifice and hard work. </p>

As time went on, local fisherman asked George to handle their product- primarily fresh fish. Packing and shipping to mostly the North, ie. Philadelphia, Boston, and New York. In time, business spread South and West- from Georgia and Florida to Illinois, Ohio and Indianapolis.</p>
